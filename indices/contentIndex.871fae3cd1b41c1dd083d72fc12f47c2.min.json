Really really pleased with how the site is starting to shape up. It is good for my brain to know it has been completed. Still some quirks to work out, no doubt, but this is very much in a happy place for me. This garden is somewhere that is nice for me to live sometimes and nice for me to tend to. Maybe one day I will be like Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock about it, hopefully not. \n\nThe broad level structure of the site should generally work like this:\n- Folder 1: Blog - sequentially linked blog posts, in chronological order detailing todo lists, and notes from that particular day, as well as thoughts and stuff. blog stuff basically\n- Folder 2: Courses - Course notes in the order that I take them. Nested based on the structure of the course. Duplicated from the note sheet from that particular day\n- Folder 3: Projects - Detailed log of how projects I have completed are done\n- Folder 4: Libary - List of media done by other people that I own, along with my review. \n\n\u0026nbsp; This is what makes the most sense in my head, I am not sure how well it will work out in reality, but it will be easy enough to rearrange. I don't want to be too rigorously structured because then that would both lock me into a way of organizing files that I might have to manually change later, and lock me into a particular way of thinking that I can't realize the consequences of until it is no longer useful. I am trying to come up with a really elegant system, basically, and I think I am getting close, but like the [[paper journaling system]] (write note later) I came up with, I will have to iterate, step by step, towards the ideal version of this system. \n\n\u0026nbsp; Hopefully the system I develop will work for other people, both in the sense of people reading my notes and people duplicating my system. I think it could be something like bullet journaling for the small internet if I get it right, both complex enough to be useful and simple enough to be flexible. \n\n\u0026nbsp; I have been brain dumping video and art ideas into another note: [[Video Ideas]] which might kinda stay my brain dump note, not sure yet exactly what system I will use long-term but it is serviceable for now. In my mind each page is conceptually kind of an index card, should be featuring not a ton of information per card, but you can stack up reading a bunch of cards both all the way up or all the way down an idea, from NAND to Tetris basically. \n\n\u0026nbsp; Eventually I will get to a point where I'm not just writing about writing!!\n\nNext post:  [[23-7-14]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T00:05:39.40835493Z","tags":[]},"/notes/23-7-14":{"title":"23-7-14","content":"Last post: [[23-7-12]]\n\n\u0026nbsp; In Gettysburg, PA for work today. This tour has been pretty insane so far. Saw some amazing things and we are far from done but I am so tired. Last night fell asleep in my work clothes with all the lights on at like 9:30.\n\n\u0026nbsp; Working on [[Library]], trying to find a way to organize art across mediums, eventually want to build jellyfin + retroarch + steam big picture basically. Basically an interface for a desktop computer that could be controlled with a video game controller. Either a switch pro controller or an xbox controller. \n\n\u0026nbsp; Really obsessed with that level of flexibility/modularity. Dymaxion stuff. It is a challenge but I think a lot of the work is in the beginning and it becomees easier to work that way as you go?\n\nNext post: [[23-7-15]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T00:05:39.40835493Z","tags":[]},"/notes/23-7-15":{"title":"23-7-15","content":"\nPrevious post: [[23-7-14]]\n\n\u0026nbsp; Touring Valley Forge, PA on a tour bus. Interesting stuff. My DIY Film School program will be called Full Stack Filmmaking - free, open source film school. Written by myself in pieces as I learn about film. Extraordinarily privilidged to basically be getting paid to do this, and want to take full advantage of that opportunity and pass it along to others. I want to write about how ART is WORK. ART is also PLAY. ART is also SCIENCE. ART is also ENGINEERING. I want to write about how you have to live a life outside of film otherwise you are just regurgitating what has come before - that perspective requires perspective. I want to write sensible advice about how to behave - on sets, in meetings, at parties. Becoming increasingly convinced that cinema is the greatest medium of art ever invented - perhaps tied with architecture. \n\n\u0026nbsp; I want to be an architect of films - make films that, upon completion, seemed inevitable - however uncertain their producition may be. \n\n\u0026nbsp; I want to make films about America, to put to words honestly and clear-eyed where we came from and to where we are going. That American history is tragic and savage and also beautiful. The complexity of those individuals created complexity we are still living with today. The creation of justice is never complete.

Have been working on the east coast since the 9th, so I am super super tired. Long days and a new city almost every night. I am taking an extra day here to see some friends and go to the Smithsonian art museum which i am rally excited about. Mostly I am glad to not have to fly out at like 4am bc that's when the rest of the group left.\n\n\u0026nbsp; I am trying to build this blog in a way that is extraordinarily simple on the surface to navigate and then the complexity of the 'digital garden' idea kind of reveals itself as you let your mind wander and click links and stuff. So that it is not confusing to first time visitors. I want to create simplicity without obscuring complexity.\n\n\u0026nbsp; Writing has primarily been brain-dumping to get practice putting one word in front of the other, but I think I am ready to start bloggin with more direct purpose. Kind of considering making most of the posts single-word titles maybe? Idk if I want to get that restrictive with it but it could be a fun challenge. \n\n\u0026nbsp; I need to learn to disipline my mind and my body ASAP in order to get where I want in life. I am twenty-two, nearly, twenty-three, so between a third and a quarter through my natural lifespan, but also pretty early into realizing the level of agency I have over the world - Or at least increasing the level of agency I have over the world? Not sure exactly which. Either way, I have a lot I want to do and time is of the essence, but I am not as capable as I want to be so I need to keep working until I am. Until I am extraordinarily capable and disciplined - it doesn't matter how much formal training I have in a subject if I have the ability to learn very fast and have the freedom to fail/the beginner's mindset. \n\n\u0026nbsp; My goal for today and tomorrow is to finish the script for my first video - I have a draft that is very, very close to completion somewhere, and order the supplies I need tonight so that I can get started filming this weekend. It's called \"How to be a filmmaker\" and it is as close as I can get to a manifesto to myself, which will be edited and expanded upon over time as I develop greater technical ability and artistic voice. I will be flying home tomorrow morning (finally!!) and taking Fri to rest. On Sat I am going to see Oppenheimer in 70mm IMAX!! Very very excited about that. I will probably begin filming on Saturday morning, or building the overhead camera rig that I designed. I am not sure of the budget for this film, so I am going to track the expenses and include it at the end. There's a purchase I want to make, but is unnecessary and too expensive for me right now, which is CW\u0026T's Time Since Launch. I would LOVE to include the device in the film and then pull the pin the moment the film goes live, but $420 plus tax is prohibitively expensive for such a small thing. I'll just have to build my own!!\n\n\u0026nbsp; I actually just now thought of the idea of building my own version of the time since launch - plus then i could set the date however I wanted \n\n\u0026nbsp; The general flow would hypothetically be research -\u003e writing -\u003e doing/filming -\u003e editing -\u003e distribution\n\nThis is a list of college degrees it would be cool to get (a list of subjects I am interested in):\n- Computer Science\n- Electrical Engineering\n- Civil Engineering\n- English\n- Studio Art\n- Graphic Design\n- Industrial Design\n- Architecture\n- Film Production\n- Acoustics\n- Analog Signal Processing\n- Digital Signal Processing\n- Physics\n- Biology\n- Audio Engineering / Music Production\n\nCertifications to Get/Software to master\n- Adobe Premier Pro\n- Adobe After Effects\n- Adobe Photoshop\n- Adobe Illustrator\n- Avid ProTools\n- KiCad\n- Godot Engine\n- Blender\n- Solidworks\n- Revit\n- Rhino/Grasshopper\n\nPatron Saints\n- Neil Gershenfeld\n- Tom Sachs\n- Neri Oxman\n- Buckminster Fuller\n- Stewart Brand\n- Lloyd Khan\n- Chris Burden\n- Virgil Abloh\n- Casey Neistat\n- Van Neistat\n- Kanye West\n- Frank Lloyd Wright\n- Le Corbusier\n- CW\u0026T\n- Ray and Charles Eames\n- Tadao Ando\n- Dieter Rams\n- Steve Jobs\n- Steve Wosniak\n- Donald Judd\n- Yoko Ono\n- Marcel Duchamp\n- Andy Warhol\n\nTimeline of my production career:\n- Pine Cove Shores Job - May 2021 - August 2021\n- DBU Media Services - October 2021 - February 2022\n- Rockpointe - \n- LeForce\n- Oak Cliff Film Festival\n- Mesquite Outlaws - First PA Gig\n- Texas Film Gear Job Interview - \n- International Leadership of Texas Job\n- Dallas International Film Festival \n- Dallas International Film Festival - Operations Manager Job Interview","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T00:05:39.40835493Z","tags":[]},"/notes/23-7-9":{"title":"23-7-9","content":"\nFinally had a breakthrough on the digital garden idea I've wanted to build for ages. Markdown based, editable in VSCode or Obsidian, global graph, homepage featuring recent notes, and hosted via GitHub pages. Have a system in my head of ways of organizing the notes but not sure how workable it will be. Going to have to demo it before building too rigid of a system. Thinking the system will roughly be 1. content notes 2. index notes, with content notes being linked to from several different index notes. Will have to explore the tagging system as well - seems like an interesting way of doing things. A project I will do this week is moving all my posts from Substack to here and converting them to markdown format, then backdating and publishing here. \n\nI will:\n- Own a home with a garden\n- Own an overlander camper\n- Own an art studio\n- Direct, write and produce a theatrically distributed feature film\n- Complete Bachelor's Degrees in:\n  - Computer Science\n  - English and Literature\n  - Civil Engineering\n  - Studio Art\n- Complete a Master of Architecture\n- Complete a PhD\n\nAnd will be publishing my notes here as I go, so that those in the future may replicate my path for free or as cheap as possible. \n- I am setting up my website as a digital garden because it will allow my thoughts to wander as I write and for readers to wander as well. \n- I am kind of thinking of it as non-linear writing, or choose-your-own-adventure style blogging or something. Not necessarily into the personal-wiki idea but not opposed to it. \n- I am using markdown because it is simple and both machine-readable and human-readable. \n- I am publishing via GitHub Pages because it is free, I like the rhythym of publishing via a push in the terminal, and because the source code IS the website. It can even be read w/o going to the actual URL by going to the quartz repo\n- I am using Quartz because it has a global graph and a most-recent posts page on the homepage, and because I can edit the files in the FOSS vscodium + foambubble OR the obsidian.md experience.\n- I am resesarching software licenses under which to publish my stuff. I want to publish EVERYTHING under something copyleft so that anyone can use anything I want. Or maybe public domain so that it is free free free and people can produce profit from my work.\n- I am working on an analog twin to this garden to belong in my physical studio. The idea would be to write everything by hand or typewriter first and then scan/retype everything to here. They wouldn't be exactly identical and it's not an efficient use of time but maybe that's the point?\n- I think I'm gonna let myself go wild here in writing/organizing of stuff, and build elegant systems for organizing information non-linearly, but concentrate all of that into linear films. I am going to focus on one project at a time, regarless of medium, and make a film about it, regardless of medium. (Greatest commandment - do something and make a film about it)\n\n\u0026nbsp; The point of this whole exercise is to learn to quiet my mind - my head that is always chaotic and often roaring feels out of control to me many times, and I have used a million different methods to still that over the years, and they all kinda coalesced into this idea - the zettelkasten or the antinet or the personal wiki or the digital garden or whatever you want to call it. I have written a million notes in a million places with temporary organization structures that become useless as soon as I move on to the next cool idea - this is a system that should be pretty impervious to that because it __allows__ for all the crazy chances, and embraces them. \n\n\u0026nbsp; I don't think all my problems will be solved once I have organized my mind just like my problems weren't all solved when I became an extreme minimalist, but I have iterated towards this point for a long time and I feel super super awesome that I figured out how to use quartz in a way that I like yesterday!! It feels a lot like the time I discovered the perfect notebook - the Clairfontaine My.Essential A5 in Dot Grid. I had gotten really obsessed with stationary when I bought a dot-grid moleskin when I was like seventeen to do a bullet journal and realized I hated the paper. I always liked cool notebooks, but couldn't articulate any qualities about them - just that this one was cool because it was leather or whatever. When I hated the expensive moleskin, I started researching other kinds of paper and notebooks, and started buying new kinds and then writing in them until they were just over half-full and then buying an new one. I learned individual things I liked about notebooks by buying and using lots I didn't, until one day I found a notebook I loved at Kinokuniya. That was almost exactly two years ago, and since then I have filled four and am working on the fifth. I don't think about notebooks anymore - I don't think about stationary anymore - I found the tool for the job - and once I found the tool I could develop the system - pretty rapidly even.\n\n\u0026nbsp; These digital gardens are easy to complicate, but I want this one to work as an elevator pitch - I want first time visitors to understand exactly what I'm doing w/o needing an explanation. This will be a challenge not of the content of the notes but of their organization. I think it is doable though!! Yesterday I completed what very much is phase 1 of the project - the manual digital garden. Markdown notes organized manually in a nonlinear way. My long-term idea is to build a digital garden + ActivityPub style software, where I can publish text, audio, photo, and video and it is automatically sorted and then the homepage is a revese chronological feed of the work - all hosted on my own site, to be published elsewhere POSSE style. I have an idea for something called nested tags - all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares. \n\n\u0026nbsp; For example, (medium)video-\u003e(genre1)narrative-\u003e(genre2)sci-fi-\u003e(subject)time travel. Something like this. I also have an idea to develop automatically assigned serial numbers for each piece of work. That one is a little more loose. We'll see.\n\nNext post: [[23-7-12]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T00:05:39.40835493Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Art-vs-Design":{"title":"Art vs Design","content":"This is something I've been ruminating on for a long time. \n\nArt is talking, design is listening.\n\nDesign is empathy for the future.\n\nDesign and art use the same mediums ()\n\nThe longer/more expensive/more permanent a creative act requires, the slower the trends in that medium move. \n\n| Design            | Art              |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n|Civil Engineering  |Video Games       |\n|Architecture       |Cinema            |\n|Industrial Design  |Fine Arts / Music |\n|Graphic Design     |\n\n| Design    | Medium | Art  |\n|:----------|:------:|-----:|\n|Copywriting|Text    |Prose |\n|Podcasts   |Audio   |Music |\n|Industrial |Video   |Cinema|\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T00:05:39.40835493Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Library":{"title":"Library","content":"|Author             |Title            |Release Date  |Medium     |Format    |\n|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|----------|\n|Anderson, Wes      |Rushmore         |1998-12-11    |Film       |Blu-ray   |\n|Anderson, Wes      |Rushmore         |1998-12-11    |Screenplay |Paperback |\n|Vinterberg, Thomas | The Celebration |1998-06-19    | Film      |Blu-ray   |\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T00:05:39.40835493Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Video-Ideas":{"title":"Video Ideas","content":"\n- How to be an imperfectionist\n- How to fold a fitted sheet\n- How to wake up at 5am every morning\n- How to exercise every day\n- How to read every day\n- How to write every day\n- How to quit eating sugar\n- How to build habits and discipline\n- How to be a filmmakaer\n- How to be an architect\n- How to be a game developer\n- How to go back to college\n- How to learn how to draw\n- How to learn how to learn\n- The lessons developers learned from Breath of the Wild, and what I hope they learn from tears of the kingdom\n- Stories that can only be told in games\n- The aesthetics of homebrew games\n- The aesthetics of iOS Jailbreaking\n- Richard Linklater: Sculpting in Time\n- Werner Herzog's Rogue Film School\n- Applying Tom Sachs' Ten Bullets to my real life\n- Magical Realism in America - How We Talk About the places we live\n  - Kentucky Route Zero, American Gods, Twin Peaks, Gravity Falls\n- Walking to \n- Designing the Criterion Collection of Video Games\n  - Bioshock\n  - Shadow of the Colossus\n  - The Last of Us Collection\n  - Earthbound\n  - Ico\n  - Firewatch\n  - Myst\n  - Beyond Good and Evil\n  - Death Stranding\n  - Kentucy Route Zero\n  - Grim Fandango\n  - Celeste\n  - The Stanley Parable\n  - Okami\n  - Portal and Portal 2\n  - Half Life Collection\n  - Mirror's Edge\n  - Cave Story\n  - Control\n  - Max Payne\n  - Elden Ring\n  - Dishonored Collection\n  - Red Dead Redemption Collection\n  - Outer Wilds\n\nArt Project Ideas\n  - Icarus Game: No visible controls, art style inspired by Kanye West - Only One video game.
