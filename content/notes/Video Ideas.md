Art Project Ideas
  - Icarus Game: No visible controls, art style inspired by Kanye West - Only One video game. Fly as close to the sun as you can, then you fall off screen and the wax hardens and comes back to an idle, flying straight forward state
  - Super-hearing room - room where very small sounds are magnified very loudly. Little interactive exhibits making small sounds you are used to in the everyday much larger. Grateful Dead wall of sound trick to prevent feedback, and a compressor to make sure the loudest sounds don't become deafening
  - Broadway Boogie-Woogie Clock - Turn each color band into a conveyor belt that will recreate the original painting every 100 years (the belts turn at different speeds)
  - Video game installation where you have to stand close to a wall with a game projected all the way across it - so that you physically have to turn your head to see what is going on in different areas
