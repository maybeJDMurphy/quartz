Art Project Ideas
  - Icarus Game: No visible controls, art style inspired by Kanye West - Only One video game. Fly as close to the sun as you can, then you fall off screen and the wax hardens and comes back to an idle, flying straight forward state
  - Super-hearing room - room where very small sounds are magnified very loudly. Little interactive exhibits making small sounds you are used to in the everyday much larger. Grateful Dead wall of sound trick to prevent feedback, and a compressor to make sure the loudest sounds don't become deafening
  - Broadway Boogie-Woogie Clock - Turn each color band into a conveyor belt that will recreate the original painting every 100 years (the belts turn at different speeds)
  - Video game installation where you have to stand close to a wall with a game projected all the way across it - so that you physically have to turn your head to see what is going on in different areas

Short Story Ideas
- The Inbetween
  - INBETWEEN JOBS
    - Research Lab building simulated worlds but cant simulate people. The sims are never the same between generations and don't ask questions - the marker of higher order thought. A lab assistant explores the simulation when he suddenly sees a familiar face - and in a mirace of punctuation, "hi, how are you?".
    - The lab assistant uses the simulation to practice talking to people 
    - The resolution is that they haven't been building simulations at all - theyve been opening partial gates to the inbetween. 
  - MANIFESTO, TEXAS
    - A guy at a downtown coffee shop gets his backpack stolen. He follows the thief into a bookstore, where he loses track of him amidst the stacks AND THE BOOKSTORE JUST KEEPS GOING
    - Eventually the books start to have stickers on the spines
    - Eventually he comes out from a forest of books into a clearing - the check out desk of a public library - and it's night
    - There is a bazaar going on outside, and the character sees the contents of his bag strewn across a rug in the trunk of a station wagon
  - CLASSICAL MECHANICS
    - University researching a magic system based on the laws of physics - you can't make the impossible happen, but you can fudge the numbers
    - Electromagnetism, Hydrodynamics, Thermodynamics, and Quantum Physics
    - OR Conservation Laws, Laws of classical mechanics, laws of gravitation and relativity, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, photonics, laws of quantum mechanics, and radiation laws 
    - Everyone is born with the ability, you just have to work REALLY hard to use it (aka study)
