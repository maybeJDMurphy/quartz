&nbsp; In Gettysburg, PA for work today. This tour has been pretty insane so far. Saw some amazing things and we are far from done but I am so tired. Last night fell asleep in my work clothes with all the lights on at like 9:30.

&nbsp; Working on [[Library]], trying to find a way to organize art across mediums, eventually want to build jellyfin + retroarch + steam big picture basically. Basically an interface for a desktop computer that could be controlled with a video game controller. Either a switch pro controller or an xbox controller. 

&nbsp; Really obsessed with that level of flexibility/modularity. Dymaxion stuff. It is a challenge but I think a lot of the work is in the beginning and it becomees easier to work that way as you go?
