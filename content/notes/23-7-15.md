&nbsp; Touring Valley Forge, PA on a tour bus. Interesting stuff. My DIY Film School program will be called Full Stack Filmmaking - free, open source film school. Written by myself in pieces as I learn about film. Extraordinarily privilidged to basically be getting paid to do this, and want to take full advantage of that opportunity and pass it along to others. I want to write about how ART is WORK. ART is also PLAY. ART is also SCIENCE. ART is also ENGINEERING. I want to write about how you have to live a life outside of film otherwise you are just regurgitating what has come before - that perspective requires perspective. I want to write sensible advice about how to behave - on sets, in meetings, at parties. Becoming increasingly convinced that cinema is the greatest medium of art ever invented - perhaps tied with architecture. 

&nbsp; I want to be an architect of films - make films that, upon completion, seemed inevitable - however uncertain their producition may be. 

&nbsp; I want to make films about America, to put to words honestly and clear-eyed where we came from and to where we are going. That American history is tragic and savage and also beautiful. The complexity of those individuals created complexity we are still living with today. The creation of justice is never complete.
